# London Bike Rides Analysis

This project analyzes bike ride data in London, focusing on generating a moving average and a heatmap. The analysis is conducted using Python and various data visualization libraries.

## Project Structure

* `london_bikes.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.
* `London Bike Rides - Moving Average and Heatmap.twbx`: Tableau workbook with visualizations for the moving average and heatmap of the bike rides.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/london-bike-rides-analysis.git
   cd london-bike-rides-analysis

2. **Install the required Python packages**:

   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl


## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook london_bikes.ipynb

2. **Run the Notebook**:

   Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the data, perform the analysis, and generate the visualizations.

3. **View Tableau Workbook**:

   Open London Bike Rides - Moving Average and Heatmap.twbx in Tableau to explore the interactive visualizations.


## Analysis Overview

### Moving Average

The moving average helps smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles in the bike ride data.

### Heatmap

The heatmap provides a visual representation of the density of bike rides over time and across different locations in London.

### Data

The data used in this analysis includes information on bike rides in London, such as the start and end times, locations, and other relevant details.

### Tutorial

This project was developed following a tutorial on YouTube. The tutorial provided step-by-step instructions on how to perform the analysis and create visualizations. You can find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl9eZl1IOKI).
